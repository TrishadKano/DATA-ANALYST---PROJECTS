## Data Science Internship Projects
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains the projects completed during my Data Science internship program. The projects focus on hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation. Each project is designed to help me gain practical skills in key areas of Data Science.

## Project List
**Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Public Dataset**

**Description**

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a publicly available dataset Titanic dataset from Kaggle).

Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and conducted basic statistical analysis.

Visualized data distributions, correlations, and key patterns using charts and graphs.

**Tools Used**

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

**Dataset**

Titanic Dataset

**Files**

E_D_A.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.




Project 2: Simple Linear Regression on Housing Prices

Description

Used a housing prices dataset (Boston Housing dataset).

Performed data preprocessing, including feature selection and normalization.

Built a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features like the number of rooms, square footage, etc.

Tools Used

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Dataset

Boston Housing Dataset

Files
